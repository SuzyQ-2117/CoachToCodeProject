                    <p>I'm an aspiring Software Engineer! After 11 years in customer-facing and B2B roles, I've recently embarked on a complete career changed, facilitated by our wonderful Reskilling Team.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>This is some more information about me. I have a dog and a partner of 10 years - we live together in sunny South Wales (LOL IT'S NEVER SUNNY HERE).</p>

                    <p>This was originally going to be a complete copy & paste of the first section so that I could see what the layout looked like, but I decided that would look silly and actually wouldn't give me the look I was trying to visualise - especially as my project will look like this current example layout.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>HTML was the first programming language I learned. I began learning HTML way back in 2017 so that I could build a custom Hive page for my department at the time. That was really when I rediscovered my love for the logic that coding embodies. </p>
